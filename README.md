# Research data supporting "Accelerated first-principles exploration of functional groups in graphene oxide"

This repository contains code and data supporting the following work:

> Z. El-Machachi, D. Frantzov, A. Nijamudheen, V. L. Deringer, _in preparation_ (2023).

The purpose is to enable readers to access the potential models and characterisation code for reproducing the work, and also to create structural models of their own of functionalised graphene sheets ("graphene oxide", GO). 

## Contents

The repository is structured in the following way:

* **Functionalisation code** The functionalisation code uses four structural parameters (_p_<sub>1</sub> to _p_<sub>4</sub>) to construct initial structural models of GO in a systematic way. 
* **Structures** The repository contains the amorphous graphene database which is used to explore the space of _p_<sub>3</sub>.
* **Models** MACE model files to be used in ASE.
* **Analysis** Includes Python scripts for: functional group counting, ring statistics, bond angle distribution, RDF, and various other analysis tools.
